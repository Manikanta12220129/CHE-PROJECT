<p><h3>As India grows and urbanizes, its water bodies become more polluted. It is estimated that approximately 70% of India's surface water is unfit for human consumption. Every day, nearly 40 million litres of wastewater enter rivers and other bodies of water, with only a small percentage adequately treated.                                                  Water pollution is the contamination of water bodies such as rivers, lakes, oceans, and groundwater by harmful substances, making it unfit for human consumption or aquatic life. Some of the most common sources of water pollution include:

    Industrial effluents .Many industries release harmful chemicals and toxins into water bodies.
    
    Agricultural practices. The use of pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers can contaminate nearby water sources.
    
    Sewage and wastewater .The discharge of untreated sewage and wastewater into water bodies can introduce harmful bacteria and viruses.
    
    Oil spills . Accidental oil spills from tankers and oil rigs can cause serious damage to marine life.
    
    Plastic pollution .The dumping of plastics into water bodies can harm marine animals and disrupt the food chain.</h3></p>

<p><h3>The effects of water pollution can be devastating, including loss of aquatic life, reduced biodiversity, and negative impacts on human health. Governments and organizations around the world are working to reduce water pollution by implementing regulations, improving treatment methods, and promoting sustainable practices.
Water pollution (or aquatic pollution) is the contamination of water bodies, usually as a result of human activities, so that it negatively affects its uses.[1]. Water bodies include lakes, rivers, oceans, aquifers, reservoirs and groundwater. Water pollution results when contaminants mix with these water bodies. Contaminants can come from one of four main sources: sewage discharges, industrial activities, agricultural activities, and urban runoff including stormwater. Water pollution is either surface water pollution or groundwater pollution. This form of pollution can lead to many problems, such as the degradation of aquatic ecosystems or spreading water-borne diseases when people use polluted water for drinking or irrigation. Another problem is that water pollution reduces the ecosystem services (such as providing drinking water) that the water resource would otherwise provide.
Sources of water pollution are either point sources or non-point sources. Point sources have one identifiable cause, such as a storm drain, a wastewater treatment plant or an oil spill. Non-point sources are more diffuse, such as agricultural runoff. Pollution is the result of the cumulative effect over time. Pollution may take the form of toxic substances (e.g., oil, metals, plastics, pesticides, persistent organic pollutants, industrial waste products), stressful conditions (e.g., changes of pH, hypoxia or anoxia, increased temperatures, excessive turbidity, changes of salinity), or the introduction of pathogenic organisms. Contaminants may include organic and inorganic substances. A common cause of thermal pollution is the use of water as a coolant by power plants and industrial manufacturers.
Control of water pollution requires appropriate infrastructure and management plans as well as legislation. Technology solutions can include improving sanitation, sewage treatment, industrial wastewater treatment, agricultural wastewater treatment, erosion control, sediment control and control of urban runoff (including stormwater management).</h3></p><br>
